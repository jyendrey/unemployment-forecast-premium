Answer yes or no. Would I select the "git apply" 
No.

You should NOT select "git apply" for these files. The "git apply" option is for applying patches or diffs, but you want to completely replace/update the existing files with the new enhanced v3.0 code.

Instead, you should:

Copy the full code I provided for each file
Replace the entire content of each existing file with the new code
Save each file with the new content
Use git add . and git commit to commit the changes
The "git apply" option would be used if I had provided patch files or diffs, but I provided complete, full file contents that need to replace your existing files entirely.

Provide the full code in the chat for each.
I'll provide the full code for each file in the chat. Here they are:
