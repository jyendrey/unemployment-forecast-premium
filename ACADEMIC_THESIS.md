### 2.2 Limitations of Existing Methods

**Data Lag**: Traditional indicators often provide data with significant delays, limiting real-time forecasting capabilities.

**Single-Source Dependency**: Most existing systems rely on single data sources, reducing robustness and accuracy.

**Limited Market Integration**: Traditional methods rarely incorporate market sentiment or trade data, missing valuable forward-looking signals.

**Statistical Validation**: Many existing systems lack comprehensive statistical validation and confidence interval calculations.

### 2.3 Emerging Trends in Economic Forecasting

**Real-Time Data Integration**: The increasing availability of real-time economic data through APIs has opened new possibilities for dynamic forecasting.

**Machine Learning Integration**: Advanced algorithms are being applied to economic forecasting, though their interpretability remains a challenge.
